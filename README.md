## About the Project
The beer game is an online game intended for students to better understand how supply chain works in a real world situation, applying the theory learned in class and practicing decision making. Therefore it is a functional type of game. This project simulates the way beer is being ordered and delivered from production and factory, going to distributor, then wholesaler and then to retailer and consumer. Each of these stages can be played by the students who, order enough beer stock in the position they hold, taking into consideration shipment times, delays, backorders, inventory such that, every partner in this chain doesn‚Äôt suffer any losses.

### Built with
* [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com)
* [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial)
* [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/starting.html)
* [Google Test](https://github.com/janoszen/clion-project-stub/blob/master/gtests/googletest/docs/Primer.md)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Getting started

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

### Prerequisites
* Qt5 SDK
```sh
brew install qt5
```
* GTest

Installion on Linux
```sh
sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
```

Installation on Mac
```sh
brew install libgtest-dev
```

### Installation
Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/iuliacornea99/se-05-team-22
```

### Run the app
```sh
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(brew --prefix qt5)
make
cd src
./beergame
```

### Run the tests
```sh
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(brew --prefix qt5)
make
cd tests
./beergame-test
```

You have to set your Qt location in CMakeLists if it doesn't work via set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH PATH_TO_QT)

### To make docs 
The documentation is automatically generated when we run `make` after `cmake ..`.

and then the documentation can be found within the directory `doc` that is inside build.

## Current UI Guide

Currently a login ui has been implement where :

For Instructor:
```
User Email : instructor
Password   : 123
Instructor : ‚úÖ (True)
```
For Player: 
```
User Email : player
Password   : 123
Instructor : (Not ticked : False)
```
(Currently we dont have an authentication mechanism.)

## User Guide
If you want to run the server and the client individually then after you build the project:

### Server
To run server :
```
cd build/src/server
./beergame-server
```
### Client
To run client :
```
cd build/src/client
./beergame-client
```
